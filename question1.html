    <h2>Social Identities and Historical Context</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Late 20th Century U.S.:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>White identity was often not racialized, with white people perceived as "neutral" or "invisible."</li>
          <li>Many white individuals were unaware of their racial privilege (<em>Color of Fear</em>).</li>
          <li>Discussions about race evoked guilt and shame, especially when confronting systemic inequalities (<em>Michael & Bartoli, 2022</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Beliefs in Colorblindness and Meritocracy:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>These beliefs perpetuated ignorance about systemic racial disparities.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Racial Fluidity in Brazil:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Race is perceived through factors like wealth, status, and appearance (<em>Stuber</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Evolving Racial Classifications in the U.S.:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Fractional classifications of African ancestry (e.g., "quadroon" and "octoroon") were used before 1930.</li>
          <li>Housing policies disproportionately favored white families, with 98% of home loans going to them over three decades.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Race and Early American History</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Slavery and Early America:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Slavery began with the farming of tobacco, as enslaved people of color were forcibly taken to work on farms.</li>
          <li>White farmers often avoided manual labor, exploiting enslaved individuals for efficiency.</li>
          <li>Following a revolt in Jamestown (1681), laws increasingly restricted the rights of people of color (<em>How America Invented Race</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Social Class and Family Dynamics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Income Disparities:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Average Asian household income: $87,200.</li>
          <li>Average Black household income: Less than half of Asian households (<em>Stuber</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Social Capital:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Defined as "the social ties that exist among people and within communities" (<em>Stuber, p. 238</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Familism in Hispanic and Asian Families:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Prioritizing family needs over individual desires strengthens bonds.</li>
          <li>Children raised with familism are more likely to seek and provide help (<em>Stuber, p. 236</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Talking About Race</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">White Families:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Often avoid discussing race, considering it a "sensitive" topic.</li>
          <li>This reluctance can lead to "colorblindness," where children are raised to "not see race" (<em>Stuber, p. 240</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Families of Color:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Race is often addressed early due to its impact on lived experiences.</li>
          <li>Among 5-year-olds:
            <ul>
              <li>82% of white children preferred playmates of their own race.</li>
              <li>Only 32% of Black children showed similar preferences (<em>Stuber, p. 240</em>).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Gender and Sexual Orientation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Historical Views:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Gender and sexual orientation were rigidly assigned at birth and rarely discussed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Modern Perspectives:</span>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sex vs. Gender:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Sex: Socially constructed categorization based on biological traits (<em>Suyemoto et al., p. 111</em>).</li>
              <li>Gender: Related to identity, expression, and societal roles (<em>Suyemoto et al., p. 111</em>).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Both are fluid and can be changed through personal identification or medical procedures.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The lived experiences of race, gender, and social class are deeply influenced by historical and cultural contexts. By understanding these dynamics, we can work toward a more equitable and inclusive society.</p>
