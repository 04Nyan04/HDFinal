    <h1>Reflections on "The Color of Fear"</h1>
    <p>From the documentary <em>The Color of Fear</em> we explored in class, a profound point was made: <strong>race is not biological</strong>. Studies reveal that <strong>99% of human genetic makeup is identical</strong>, regardless of external differences.</p>

    <h2>The Evolutionary Context of Skin Color</h2>
    <p>The physical traits we often associate with race, such as skin color, are results of environmental adaptations over time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Darker skin tones</strong> evolved to offer better protection from the sun in regions with high UV exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighter skin tones</strong> evolved to absorb more vitamin D in areas with less sunlight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These differences are adaptive traits, not indicators of separate races. In essence, race is not biologically real; it is a <strong>social construct</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What is a Social Construct?</h2>
    <p>A social construct is a concept or perception created and agreed upon by society. It often includes stereotypes or generalizations about groups of people.</p>
    <p>For example, in early America, laws differentiated between people of color and white individuals. Many white people perpetuated the belief that Black people were weaker. This belief was a social construct that shaped systemic discrimination. Without these constructs, society might not categorize or judge people based on race.</p>

    <h2>Gender: A Mix of Biology and Social Influence</h2>
    <p>When discussing gender, we encounter a blend of biological and societal elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biological aspects of gender:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Males and females typically have distinct genitalia, identifiable at birth or in the womb.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Choice and gender identity:</strong> While gender is rooted in biology, individuals can choose to undergo gender transition procedures to align with their personal identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sexual Orientation and Social Constructs</h2>
    <p>Sexual orientation, on the other hand, is less about biology and more about personal choice and societal influence. Historically, social constructs stigmatized same-sex relationships or gender transitions. However, society is increasingly open to conversations about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gender identity and transitioning.</li>
        <li>Acceptance of same-sex relationships and marriages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By examining these ideas, we can better understand how social constructs shape our perceptions and how societal change allows for more inclusive discussions on identity and equality.</p>
